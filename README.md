# Namaste _/\\\_ <br>


### Iâ€™m currently learning: 
- Git & GitHub
- Web development
- Programming Fundamentals (future learning)

### I enjoy:
- Reading books, surfing internet for new content.
- Doing Yoga, Aasana, Pranayama and Meditation.
- Getting out in nature and hiking.

I have recently signed up on GitHub and created my first GitHub repository. Successfully clone it to my local git repository. Completed the learning tutorials on Git essentials and Git Branches. I am looking forward to host, share, fork and collaborate in various projects in GitHub as my career advances in the development world.
